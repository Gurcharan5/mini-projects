# **About** 

A collection of mini projects I've created over time to build my programming skills and showcase my progress
Projects are in order of oldest (1) to newest.

## **Notable Mentions**

- In project 3, I begin to explore .gitignore and .env files to hold api keys and sensitive data. I also begin to explore developing GUI applications using tkinter.

- In project 5, I begin to explore cyber engineering project, in this case a key generator and checker which follows a certain pattern.

- Project 6 is a continuation of cyber engineering, in this case making use of a Ceasur cipher to encrypt and decrpyt data.
